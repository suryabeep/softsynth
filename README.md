# softsynth

This project used the code at https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/254421/modular-synthesizer-framework-for-c as a starting point. I have since incorporated other DSP
stuff from sources around the web, and implemented some additional features of my own. The intention of this code is to eventually be used as an augmentation for my hardware synth setup at home. I don't really care about a GUI at the moment as I will most likely be using MIDI I/O as required.
